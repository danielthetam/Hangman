class Hangman:
    """
    MAIN LOGIC
    In the constructor, first choose a word and declare the needed starting variables.
    Then, run the game, print the number of letters in the word and ask the user to guess
    If the guessed letter is valid and isn't wrong, reveal the word and check if the word has been completed
    If the guessed letter is valid but is wrong, increment the number of rows shown and add it to their list of used letters.

    DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple hangman game you can run in your terminal.
    Feel free to change the number of lives a player can have by editing the art in the 'hangman_art' text file. Lives are determined by the number of rows in the art.
    Feel free to edit the pool of random words and phrases that will be used in the game through the 'hangman_words' text file.
